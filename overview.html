								<h1>Motivation</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>With the recent results of the Philippine Elections, fake news has been a prominent topic provided that some candidates were able to utilize misinformation to promote their platforms during the election period. One of said candidates is Bongbong Marcos (BBM), which according to an investigation made by Inquirer (<a href=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1068051/troll-armies-wage-history-war-to-push-marcos-comeback>2018</a>), 100 Facebook Pages with over 6 million followers were propagating misinformation about the Marcoses, Martial Law, personal achievements and plunder cases. In addition to this, Rappler (<a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/ferdinand-bongbong-marcos-jr-tries-take-over-twitter-freshly-made-accounts/">2022</a>) provided a data showcasing that majority of Twitter users which used the tag #LabanMarcos Marcos was only created near BBM’s declaration of his candidacy. This report by Rappler implies that these users may have been created for the purpose of promoting BBM’s presidential campaign. Having said that, the motivation of this study is to determine if tweets containing misinformation or disinformation on projects made by the Marcoses were only driven by the presidential campaign by identifying the dates and times these tweets were made.</p>

							<p><strong>Research question: </strong>
                                Did the Philippine Elections play a significant role in the number of tweets involving the Marcoses (Imee, BBM, Ferdinand) credit grabbing?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>Hypothesis: </strong>
                                The timing of the Philippine elections correlates with the number of mis/disinformation tweets regarding credit grabbing the Marcos Family (ie. Imee, Bbm and ferdinand)
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>Null Hypothesis: </strong>
                                The timing of the Philippine elections does not correlate with the numbe rof mis/disinformation tweets regarding credit grabbing the Marcos Family (ie. Imee, Bbm and ferdinand)
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>Action plan: </strong>
                                Analyze the dates and number of tweets that were posted related to the credit grabbing of the Marcoses.
