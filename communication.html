							<h1>Introduction</h1>
									<p>With the recent results of the 2022 Philippine Presidential Elections, fake news became a widespread topic due 
										to the rampant misinformation propagated in social media platforms promoting certain candidates. One of said 
										candidates is Bongbong Marcos (BBM), which according to an investigation made by Inquirer, 100 Facebook Pages 
										related to BBM with over 6 million followers were spreading misinformation about Martial Law, personal achievements
										 and plunder cases.1 In addition to this, Rappler provided a data showcasing that majority of Twitter users which used
										  the tag #LabanMarcos were only created near BBM’s declaration of his candidacy.2 This report by Rappler implies that these Twitter users may have been created for the purpose of promoting BBM’s presidential campaign. Given these findings, the objective of this study is to determine if the number of credit grabbing tweets associated with BBM may have significantly changed during the presidential campaign period. The results from this study may be used to identify which possible events could have triggered the spike in fake news for future fact-checking algorithms.</p>
