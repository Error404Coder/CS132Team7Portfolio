							<h1>Introduction</h1>
									<p>
										With the recent results of the 2022 Philippine Presidential Elections, fake
									news became a widespread topic due to the misinformation propagated in
									social media platforms promoting certain candidates [1][2][3]. One of said
									candidates is Bongbong Marcos (BBM), which based on a Rappler report
									showed majority of Twitter users which used the hashtag #LabanMarcos
									were only created near BBM’s declaration of candidacy [4]. This report by
									Rappler implies that these Twitter users may have been created for the
									purpose of promoting BBM’s presidential campaign. Given these findings,
									the objective of this study is to determine if the number of credit grabbing
									tweets associated with BBM may have significantly changed during the
									presidential campaign period.
									</p>
							<h1>Materials and Methods</h1>
										<p>The methodology can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
										<p>1. Collecting credit-grabbing tweets spanning the campaign period 
											using the Python library snscrape</p>
										<img src="images/meth1.png" class="center-inline-img" id="meth1">
										
										<p>2. Manual misinformation labeling with VERA Files criteria as basis </p>

										<p>3. Data preprocessing and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly</p>

										<p>4. Computing statistical significance with Kruskall Mann-Whitney U Tests</p>

										<p>5. Determining specific spikes in misinformation using Event Detection Modeling</p>

							<p>
								Given that the p-value is less than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis,
								i.e., there is no significant difference in the number of BBM credit-grabbing tweets before,
								during and after the campaign period. This implies that the number of BBM credit-grabbing
								tweets may have been prevalent before and after the campaign period. To confirm this, a post
								hoc analysis was also performed

								</tr>
							</table>
							
							<p>
								With the p-value less than the significance level for the campaign vs pre-campaign
								datasets, the null hypothesis is rejected, i.e., BBM credit-grabbing tweets are significantly
								less during the campaign period compared to the pre-campaign period. It may be the case
								that BBM credit-grabbing tweets were even more widespread before the campaign period
								has started
							</p>

							<p>
								Numerous dates pop up in the event detection model. October 20 and 21, 2021 are the first
								dates of the peak and the change event, respectively. These dates are within the same
								month as the date that Bongbong Marcos filed for his certificate of candidacy (COC) on
								October 6, 2021. Note that after the peak and the change points, there is a noticeable
								drop in the number of misinformation tweets. It was on January 24 and January 30 of 2022
								that the number of tweets started to rise again. This drop might be explained by Twitter’s
								report on suspending hundreds of twitter accounts for violating platform manipulation and
								spam policy. The next and last change point detected was on May 29, 2022, weeks after
								the election. Little to no tweets appeared afterwards, until September 2022 where another
								peak can be seen, September 23, 2022. This peak could be the result of Joe Biden praising
								BBM for his ‘work’ on windmills, on September 22, 2022 at the UN General Assembly.
							</p>

							</p>
							<h1>Conclusion and Implications</h1>
								<p>
									From the statistical tests, it can be concluded that BBM credit-grabbing tweets were
									already prevalent before the presidential campaign. It is therefore recommended to explore
									data beyond the project’s data collection timeline, October 2021 to September 2022, in order
									to trace the wave of misinformation associated with the 2022 Philippine Elections. Moreover,
									the analysis of the dates shows that BBM’s filing for COC, the suspension of pro-BBM
									Twitter accounts, the end of elections, and Joe Biden’s mention of the windmills occurs near
									the peaks and change points of dis/misinformation tweets. These dates could be further
									studied to determine the existence/non-existence of a correlation and/or causation to the
									amount of dis/misinformation tweets.
								</p>
								<p>

									This study can help with fact checking organizations in order to know and predict when misinformation is 
									most prevalent, and to allot their resources accordingly.
										These findings could also be integrated into machine learning models of misinformation detector in order to make them more accurate.
