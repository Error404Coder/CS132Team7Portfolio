							<h1>Introduction</h1>
									<p>With the recent results of the 2022 Philippine Presidential Elections, fake news became a widespread topic due 
										to the rampant misinformation propagated in social media platforms promoting certain candidates. One of said 
										candidates is Bongbong Marcos (BBM), which according to an investigation made by Inquirer, 100 Facebook Pages 
										related to BBM with over 6 million followers were spreading misinformation about Martial Law, personal achievements
										 and plunder cases.1 In addition to this, Rappler provided a data showcasing that majority of Twitter users which used
										  the tag #LabanMarcos were only created near BBM’s declaration of his candidacy.2 This report by Rappler implies that these Twitter users may have been created for the purpose of promoting BBM’s presidential campaign. Given these findings, the objective of this study is to determine if the number of credit grabbing tweets associated with BBM may have significantly changed during the presidential campaign period. The results from this study may be used to identify which possible events could have triggered the spike in fake news for future fact-checking algorithms.</p>
							<h1>Materials and Methods</h1>
										<p>The methodology can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
										<p>Collecting credit-grabbing tweets spanning the campaign period 
											using the Python library snscrape</p>
										<p>Manual misinformation labeling with VERA Files
criteria as basis [5]
a. Is it a statement of fact?
b. Is it feasible?
c. Is it relevant?</p>

										<p>Data preprocessing and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and</p>
										<p>Computing statistical significance with Mann-Whitney U </p>
										<p>Determining specific spikes in misinformation using Event Detection Mod</p>

								Given that the p-value is less than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis,
								i.e., there is no significant difference in the number of BBM credit-grabbing tweets before,
								during and after the campaign period. This implies that the number of BBM credit-grabbing
								tweets may have been prevalent before and after the campaign period. To confirm this, a post
								hoc analysis was also performe

							<p>
								With the p-value less than the significance level for the campaign vs pre-campaign
								datasets, the null hypothesis is rejected, i.e., BBM credit-grabbing tweets are significantly
								less during the campaign period compared to the pre-campaign period. It may be the case
								that BBM credit-grabbing tweets were even more widespread before the campaign period
								has started

							<h1>Implications</h1>
									<p>asd</p>
							<h1>Conclusion</h1>
									<p>From the statistical tests, it can be concluded that BBM credit-grabbing tweets were already
prevalent before the presidential campaign. It is therefore recommended to explore data beyond
the project’s data collection timeline, October 2021 to September 2022, in order to trace the wave of
misinformation associated with the 2022 Philippine Electi</p>
